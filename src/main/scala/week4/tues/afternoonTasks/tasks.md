# Afternoon Task: Higher order functions.

## MVP:

### Passing a function as an argument:

Question 1.

a. Create a function called `intDoubler` that takes an input of type `Int` and returns an `Int`. This method will return
the input `Int` doubled.

b. Create a second function called `applyTwice` that takes two parameters.

i. The first parameter is an `input:Int`.

ii. The second parameter is a function called `f` that takes an `Int` and returns an `Int`. (Having this as a parameter makes the `applyTwice` method a higher order function.)

iii. The `applyTwice` function must apply `f` twice in succession to the `input`.

c. Call the `applyTwice` function passing in the `intDoubler` as your `f`.

(E.g. `applyTwice(4, intDoubler)` should equal 16)

Question 2.

a. Create 4 functions (addition, multiplication, division, subtraction), each taking two doubles as inputs and returning a `Double` as the result.

b. Create a function called `IntManipulator` that takes in two doubles and a mathematical operation (as made above) as a function and returns the result as a double.

### Returning a function:

Question 3.

a. Create a function called `convertToUpperCase` that takes any string input and returns that string as uppercase.

b. Create a function called `convertToLowerCase` that takes any string input and returns that string as lowercase.

c. Create a third function called `stringConverter` that takes a Boolean input with parameter name `makeStringUpperCase`. If the input is `true`, return the `convertToUpperCase` method; if `false`, return the `convertToLowerCase` method.

d. Copy `val testString = "cOnVeRtMe"` and apply your `stringConverter` method to your `testString` and print the result when the input is `true` and when it is `false`.

Question 4.

a. Create a `calculate` method that takes an input called `operation: String` and pattern matches it to return one of the previously written methods from question 2; `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.

(Example: `calculate("add")` will return the `add` method from Q2)

b. Try applying different string inputs to the `calculate` method to return each of the arithmetic methods.

c. What happens if you enter an input that doesnâ€™t match any of the methods? Should we account for this in our pattern match? What would change if we did?

## Extension and Research:

Question 1.

a. Create a function called `max` that takes two Doubles and returns the maximum of the two numbers. (HINT: research and use the built-in `max` method.)

b. Create a function called `maxListNum` that takes a list of doubles and the `max` function made in part a. It should return the largest number in the list. (HINT: research and use the built-in `reduce` method.)

Question 2.

a. Create a function named `applyFunc` that takes two parameters: a function of type `Int => Int` and a `givenInt: Int`. The `applyFunc` should apply the function parameter to the `givenInt` and return the result.

b. Create two functions, one named `triple` that triples the `givenInt`, and one named `square` that squares the `givenInt`.

c. Use the `applyFunc` to apply the `triple` and `square` methods to the number 5 and print the result.

Question 3.

a. Create a function named `power` that takes an `exponent: Int` and returns a function `Int => Int`. The returned function should take a `base: Int` and raise it to the power of `exponent`. (HINT: research and use `Math.pow()`)

b. Use the above `power` function to create a `square` function that squares numbers (base 2).

c. Apply the `square` function to the number 6 and print the result.

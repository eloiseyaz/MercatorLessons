## Afternoon Task: String interpolation and if/else statements
### MVP:
John from primary school maths is trying to buy as many watermelons as possible and we need to give him a reality check. John can reasonably carry 3 watermelons without a bag, and 5 with one bag.
1. Create a value to store a number of watermelons.
2. Use an if/else statement to print out appropriate messages based on the criteria above to tell John
   whether he: \
   a) Doesn't need a bag \
   b) Needs a bag \
   c) Can't carry them \
   Consider how you will handle invalid numbers.
3. Use string interpolation to add to each message the number of watermelons John is trying to buy -
   which type of string interpolation is most appropriate here?
4. Create a value to store a boolean that indicates whether John has a bag with him or not.
5. Use an if statement and this boolean value to tell John whether he can or cannot by the desired
   number of watermelons in Task 1. Can this be done without using "else if"?
6. The store puts their prices in a foreign currency, so the conversion rate to £ means one
   watermelon is £1.397. Calculate and use string interpolation to display the total cost of John's
   purchase to 2 decimal places - which type is most appropriate here?

### Extension:
   Logical operators used in IF statements (e.g., && or <) have an order of precedence.
1. What is this order, or where can we find it?
   Let's try to apply it, try to predict the answer before coding it:
2. What would (true || false && false) result in?
3. What about ((true || false) && false)? Note the parentheses used here.
4. And finally, how about (1 < 4 && 7 != 10 || 9 + 10 == 21)?

### Research:
   If statements always return values. This means we can assign values based on if statements.
   How would we go about doing this, or where could we search to find out?
   Try out the example below:
1. Create two values that hold integers. Assign any integer you'd like to these values.
2. Create a new value to hold a string and assign it "yes" if the first value is greater than the second,
   and "no" if the second value is greater.
   (Don’t overthink this!)

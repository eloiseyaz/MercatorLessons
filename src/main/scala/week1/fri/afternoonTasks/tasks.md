## Afternoon Task: Functions, methods and for comprehensions
### MVP:
1. Write a method to calculate the square of an `Int`. It should have an input parameter `Int`
   and return type `Int`.
2. Write a method to check if a number is odd. It should have an input parameter `Int` and
   return type `Boolean`.
3. Using a for comprehension and your methods from MVP Q1 and Q2, write a method
   called `sumOfOddNumbers` that has an input parameter of `List[Int]` and return type of `Int`.
   This method should:
   * Will iterate over a `List` of `Int`s
   * Will square each `Int` in the `List`
   * Will filter and keep only the odd squared values
   * Then, return the sum of these odd squared numbers
4. Make a simple grading system that calculates a student’s overall grade based on their
   scores in different subjects (Math, Science and English). The grades are given in the table below:
    
    | Average Score | Grade |
    |---------------|-------|
    | 90+           | A     |
    | 80-89         | B     |
    | 70-79         | C     |
    | 60-69         | D     |
    | 0-59          | E     |
    For example, if a student achieves 45 in Maths, 89 in
    History and 60 in science, the average score would be
    64.67 - they would average at a grade D overall.\
    Your grading system will:
    * Calculate the average score from a list of scores.
    * Determine the grade based on the average score.

### Extension:
1. Write a function to interact with the terminal. If you enter the word `”Hello”`, have the
   command line return `“Hello X”`, where X is a given name.
2. Expand on your basic terminal interaction from above. Have a small conversation given
   specific inputs (this can be about anything you like; weather, films, sports…)
3. Go back to your grading system from MVP Q4. Use functions to log
   information to the console and interact with the user. The user should
   be able to:\
   a. When prompted in terminal, input the score for each subject.\
   b. See the final grade printed to the terminal as a whole number.

### Research:
Have a look into Pure and Impure functions.\
a. What are the positive and negatives of each?\
   b. What is better practice to use? Why? Does this ever change?\
   c. Look back over each function written in this afternoon task. Are they pure or impure
   functions? Why?

## Afternoon Task: Collections
### MVP:
1. a) Make a List of the numbers from 1-5, and a Seq of the primary colours.\
   b) Write a function to multiply all the values in your List by 3.\
   c) Write a function that removes “Blue” from your Seq.\
   d) Write a function that returns ‘true’ if your Seq contains “Orange”.
2. Write a function that maps each value in your List to true or false, depending on whether they are odd.
3. David has many pets; 2 dogs, 1 fish and 1 cat.\
   a) Make a Map which details the key -> value pair of “Name” -> “Animal”.\
   b) Write a function that returns a List of the names of David’s dogs.
### Extension:
1. Starting with a Seq of Ints from 1 to 9, come up with 2 filters that, after you’ve applied them, will return Seq(1, 2, 5, 7).
2. The .head function returns the first element of a list, and the .tail function returns everything except the first element. Using only the .head and .tail functions, retrieve the 3rd element of a List.
### Research:
1. What makes a Set different from a Seq? What should Set(1,2) == Set(2,1,1,1) return?
2. What do you think List(3,4) == Seq(3,4) will return? Why?
3. What about List(5,6) == Set(5,6)?

## Research
### Task 1
`val new: String = "hello"` \
We can't have a value called `new` because this is a keyword. It's used to make an instance of a class.

### Task 2
For code to compile it needs to be free of syntax errors. These are errors such as declaring a val/var as the wrong type, using a keyword as a val/var name or trying to change a value.

### Task 3
You can't use any of scala's other keywords either. These are as follows:
* `abstract`
* `case`
* `catch`
* `class`
* `def`
* `do`
* `else`
* `extends`
* `false`
* `final`
* `finally`
* `for`
* `forSome`
* `if`
* `implicit`
* `import`
* `lazy`
* `match`
* `new`
* `null`
* `object`
* `override`
* `package`
* `private`
* `protected`
* `return`
* `sealed`
* `super`
* `this`
* `throw`
* `trait`
* `true` 
* `try`
* `type`
* `val`
* `var`
* `while`
* `with`
* `yield`

## Afternoon Task: Storing values, types and operators

### MVP:
1. Before coding, decide if the answer will be true or false and why, then use operators to store values
   relating to the following: \
   a) Three plus four, times fifty-seven is less than three-hundred \
   b) One-hundred and forty-four, divided by 12 is greater than twelve or equal to twelve \
   c) Cat is less than Dog (strings) \
   d) Rabbit is less than Hamster (strings) \
   e) Seventeen is odd (modulus) \
   f) Seventy-five divided by nine is less than thirty and eighty-nine divided by six is less than twenty
2. What is the difference between a string (e.g. “I love scala already”) and a print line (e.g. println (“I
   love scala already”))?
3. Have a play in a scala worksheet using everything we have learnt today. What is possible? What
   isn’t? Is there anything that you have done that you think is pretty cool or that’s strange?
   
### Extension:
1. “STRING” == “string”
   Is this true or false? Why?
2. Can you convert the string “one” to the int 1?
3. Can you convert the int 1 to string “one”?
4. Can you convert int 1 to a string? Is the result as you would expect?
5. Convert a lowercase string to uppercase.
6. Convert on the first letter of a string to uppercase.

### Research:
1. Make a val called new which is type string. Why doesn’t this compile?
2. What do we need to do within our code to make it compile?
3. Are there any other words that you cannot use?
